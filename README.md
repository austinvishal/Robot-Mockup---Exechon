# Description of the Model

This repository provides insights into inverse kinematics of the famous Exechon Tripod robot and visual mockup representations

<p align="center">

The video below shows a simple trajectory followed by parallel robot and different working mode configurations.

# Graphic Mockup

A library of graphical and computational tools has been written in order to simplify the analysis and to provide a sophisticated and effective mockup.
